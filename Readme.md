# Probability of (not) having Covid

Here I will try to calculate the probability of not having Covid given that I have negative test results, using Bayes Theorem.

This project is just for fun and it should not be taken as medical advice, because I'm not an expert.

It is very likely that I made some mistakes either in my calculations or my assumptions (please let me know if you find any!). It is also possible that I am underestimating Omicron or even new undiscovered variants of the virus.

I will keep getting tested in the following days. Please do the same :)
