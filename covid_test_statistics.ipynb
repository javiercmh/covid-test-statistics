    "\n",
    "This approach uses Bayes theorem which can be formally defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down into its components.\n",
    "- P(H|E) is the probability of a hypothesis being true given an event. In this example, I am interested to know what is the probability of not having Covid given that I got a negative test result.\n",
    "- P(E|H) is the probability of my test being negative given that I don't have Covid. This is called the \"specificity\" of the test.\n",
    "- P(H) is the prior probability of not having Covid.\n",
    "- P(E) is the probability of a test being negative. This can be broken down even more:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(H)*P(E|H) + P(¬H) * P(E|¬H)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(¬H) is the probability of having Covid (remember that my hypothesis H is that I don't have Covid).\n",
    "- P(E|¬H) is the probability of a test being negative given that I have Covid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though I only need specificity, I will still document specificity and sensitivity in case I need them in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity and specificity will come from the most recent studies ([Dinnes et al., 2021](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013705.pub2/full); [Turcato et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721008573)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both studies used data up to end of 2020, which is not very recent, so I will stick to the most conservative values, considering that antigen tests could be worse at detecting the new Omicron variant of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I will distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, because the statistical properties differ among them."
